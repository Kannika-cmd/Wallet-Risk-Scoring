1. Fetch Transaction History
Data Collection Method:

Use the Aave V2 or V3 API to fetch transaction data for each wallet address. The API provides endpoints to retrieve transaction history, including deposits, withdrawals, and other relevant activities.
For each wallet address, make a GET request to the appropriate endpoint, ensuring to handle any potential errors (e.g., rate limits, timeouts).
2. Data Preparation
Feature Selection Rationale:

Total Transactions: The number of transactions can indicate activity level.
Total Value: The total value of transactions reflects the financial engagement of the wallet.
Average Transaction Value: This can indicate the typical size of transactions, which may correlate with risk.
Transaction Frequency: The frequency of transactions over a specific period can indicate volatility or stability.
Last Transaction Time: The recency of the last transaction can indicate whether the wallet is currently active.
Data Processing Steps:

Convert timestamps to datetime objects.
Group the data by wallet address and aggregate the features.
Normalize the features using Min-Max scaling to ensure they are on a similar scale.
3. Risk Scoring
Scoring Method:

Assign weights to each feature based on its perceived risk impact. For example:
Total Transactions: 20%
Total Value: 30%
Average Transaction Value: 20%
Transaction Frequency: 20%
Last Transaction Time: 10%
Calculate the risk score using a weighted sum of the normalized features, scaling the final score to a range of 0 to 1000
4. Deliverables
CSV File: Save the final DataFrame with wallet IDs and scores to a CSV file.
Justification of Risk Indicators Used
Total Transactions: A higher number of transactions may indicate higher engagement but could also suggest higher risk if associated with volatile trading behavior.
Total Value: Larger total values can indicate significant financial activity, which may correlate with higher risk.
Average Transaction Value: This helps identify whether the wallet is making large or small transactions, which can be indicative of risk appetite.
Transaction Frequency: Frequent transactions may indicate active trading, which can be riskier than a more stable approach.
Last Transaction Time: Recent activity suggests that the wallet is still in use, which can be a risk factor if associated with high volatility.
